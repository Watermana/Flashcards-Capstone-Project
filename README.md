# Flashcards-Capstone-Project
Capstone Project for the Frontend Development Section

# Purpose
This project is supposed to operate similarly to quizlett, a website used for studying with interactive flashcards.

# Functionality
With this project you can create, read, update, and delete cards and decks. To study you simply click on a deck that you
wish to study, and you are presented with the first card. You then click flip, which flips to the back of the card,
and gives you the option to move on to the next card. At the end you may either restart the deck or go back to the home
page and select a new one.

# Technologies
This project was built in React.js, and utilizing Bootstrap for styling. It uses useState, useEffect, and the React Router.
It also uses jest for unit testing.

# Discoveries
This project taught me more about how the react useEffect hook works, and how to conditionally render to the page based
on state. It also was helpful for learning how to interact with RESTful apis on the front end.
